          <h1>About</h1>
          <div>
            I'm Sagar S, a dedicated and forward-thinking professional with a
            dual passion for data science and web development. With a solid
            foundation in coding and a keen interest in creating impactful
            digital solutions, I'm excited to contribute my skills to dynamic
            teams and innovative projects. I am the branch topper of Computer
            Science Engineering with specialization in IOT branch in the
            prestigious Vellore Institute of Technology. I have achieved a CGPA
            of 9.87 and have gained insightful knowledge in the fields of
            networking and database management by understanding various concepts
            in VIT's meticulously planned course curriculum. Throughout my three
            years of exploration and learning, I've honed my proficiency in
            programming languages like Java ,C++ ,Python and C. This expertise
            not only empowers me to analyze intricate datasets but also enables
            me to craft intuitive coding solutions that integrate my knowledge
            of data-structures and Algorithms. My commitment to continuous
            learning has led me to gain hands-on experience in machine learning,
            and other coding domains. As a student, I am very passionate about
            Web development ,Machine learning and deep learning and have been
            working hard to gain knowledge in the field.
